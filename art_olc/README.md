# ART Synchronized

This repository provides an implementation of the Adaptive Radix Tree (ART) in a thread safe manner.
Two different synchronization schemes are used, Optimistic Lock Coupling and Read-Optimized-Write-Exclusion (ROWEX).

The techniques used are described in the following papers:

- "The Adaptive Radix Tree: ARTful Indexing for Main-Memory Databases": https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf
- "The ART of Practical Synchronization": DaMoN 2016 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2933352

## Required packages
- cmake
- C++ 14 compiler
- tbb
- jemalloc

for Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libtbb-dev libjemalloc-dev

## Build instructions
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make


## Execution instructions
Run the example test with:

    ./example n 0|1|2
    
    n: number of keys
    0: sorted keys
    1: dense keys
    2: sparse keys

Note that there may not be any keys that are prefixes of other keys.
This can be achieved by all keys having the same length or by always passing the null terminator as part of the key.

## Known problems

Some g++ versions fail to link jemalloc.
Ensure with ldd that jemalloc is linked.
If it's not then either use clang or load jemalloc manually:

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/jemalloc.so ./example ...
