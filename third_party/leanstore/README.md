**Note:** This is a fork of [LeanStore](https://github.com/leanstore/leanstore)
from commit `d3d83143ee74c54c901fe5431512a46965377f4e` with a few patches to (i)
set the page size and alignment to match TreeLine (4 KiB), and (ii) to enable
compilation as a part of TreeLine's benchmarks (fixed some naming conflicts).

# LeanStore
[LeanStore](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/leanstore.pdf) is a high-performance OLTP storage engine optimized for many-core CPUs and NVMe SSDs. Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to in-memory systems when the data set fits into RAM, while being able to fully exploit the bandwidth of fast NVMe SSDs for large data sets. While LeanStore is currently a research prototype, we hope to make it usable in production in the future.

## Compiling
Install dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install cmake libaio-dev libtbb-dev`

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. && make -j`

## TPC-C Example
`build/frontend/tpcc --ssd_path=./ssd_block_device_or_file --worker_threads=120 --pp_threads=4 --dram_gib=240 --tpcc_warehouse_count=100 --notpcc_warehouse_affinity --csv_path=./log --cool_pct=40 --free_pct=1 --contention_split --xmerge --print_tx_console --run_for_seconds=60`

check `build/frontend/tpcc --help` for other options
